# Novel AI scenarios
## Summary
This is a repository for my current scenarios and the template I'm currently using.

## FAQ
### Why do different scenarios have different settings from each other or from the template?
I'm going to try to keep the template updated to community best-practice standards as long as they don't conflict with my experience. But if a given scenario seems to be working well with certain settings, I'm not going to change them until testing demonstrates the new standards work well _with that scenario._ Also, sometimes I experiment with new settings in a scenario before modifying the template.

### Why are there both JSON and YAML versions of scenarios?
I write everything in YAML and then convert to JSON for a few reasons:
1. Comments: it really helps to have comments to navigate complex scenario lorebooks
2. Readability: YAML is shorter and more readable
3. Convertability: There are tools that convert back and forth between YAML and JSON with no loss of fidelity (except comments).

### What version should I use?
Unless you want to modify the scenario AND want to work with YAML AND can easily convert the files, just grab the JSON. The conversion has been done for convenience.
