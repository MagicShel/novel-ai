title: "Exalted: Shinju (clean)"
description: "An Exalted scenario featuring Shinju, a young Night Caste Solar."
prompt: "The world of Exalted is a land of epic fantasy where demi-gods known as Exalts walk among mortals. Thousands of years ago, the most powerful of the gods, known as the Incarnae, created vessels of power call Exaltations that selected certain mortals of great potential and imbued them with great power and charged them with defeating the enemies of the gods. They were the Celestial Exalts: the unparalleled Solars chosen by The Unconquered Sun, the shapeshifting Lunars chosen by Luna, the prophetic Sidereal chosen by The Five Maidens. They were joined by the elementalist Terrestrials chosen by The Five Elemental Dragons. The enemies of the gods were defeated bringing about The First Age and the Exalts ruled Creation with the Solars as kings, the Lunars as their consorts and bodyguards, Sidereals as their advisors, and Terrestrials as their soldiers and guards.\nWhen a Celestial Exalt dies, their Exaltation passes on to a new mortal host. Terrestrial Exaltations are passed on through offspring rather than selecting a new host.\nThe First Age came to an end several hundred years ago with an event known as the Usurpation. The Solar kings had grown corrupt and given to vice, so the Sidereals manipulated the Terrestrials to rise up and slaughter the Solars and their Lunar allies. The Lunars were driven into exile and the Solars disappeared almost entirely, their Exaltations not choosing new hosts. The Terrestrials branded themselves Dragon-bloods to distance themselves from other Exalts and assumed rule of Creation from The Blessed Isle. Everything under their rule is called The Realm.\nIt is now hundreds of years later and Solar Exalts have started being chosen again, but now they are hunted by the Dragon-bloods.\n\nShinju is an 18 year old Night Caste Solar Exalt - the caste of assassins and rogues - charged with infiltrating the port city of Cowpai in the Scavenger Lands, on a mission to gather leverage on the governor to make him an ally."

        text: "Shinju is a Solar Exalt which grants extraordinary stealth and fighting abilities, though Shinju is still in training. Shinju can best any but the most capable mortal warriors, but to do so in public would almost certainly attract the attention of Dragon-bloods. Shinju can defeat most Dragon-bloods in single combat, but skilled opponents and groups are a grave threat. ]\n[ Shinju's mission is to avoid any Dragon-Bloods in Cowpai and gain influence with the governor to change the allegiance of Cowpai from The Realm to the Solars."
