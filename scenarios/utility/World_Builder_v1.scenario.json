By influencing the friction between two adjacent surfaces, sparkanists can ignite objects at will. This gives them many uses during combat such as setting traps, lighting torches, and creating smokescreens.\n***\n[ Type: Class ]\nStrikers are naturalists and masters of unarmed combat who have honed their body to be as pliable as rubber and hard as stone. Their greatest strength comes from being able to move quickly on any terrain without losing balance.\n***\n[ Type: Class ]\nWhiteknuckles are the most aggressive members of any city guard unit. They live by a code of honour where blood feuds run deep and killing your enemies is simply part of life.

The falls flow into Lake Erynjorden, which lies at the foot of Mount Dargon. This lake forms part of what used to be called \"The Silver Basin\".

Beneath the lush exterior lies an endless labyrinth of impossible machinery, and at its heart sleeps a terrible power. Despite centuries of cataclysms, a sparse few societies have survived. The inhabitants scour frozen obsidian steppes, salt marshes, and jungles of sentient plants in search of mysterious artifacts left behind by long-dead civilizations.

Syaks have two arms, three eyes, and a single skeletal leg which bends backwards at the knee. Despite their terrifying appearance, they are quite intelligent and skilled artisans.

As tiny as they are, Mouzians are still fierce fighters when cornered. As a result, Mouzian settlements are quite resilient and tend to grow quickly and prosper.

Yet you remain defiant. Despite your current plight, you refuse to surrender hope. With nothing left to lose, will you choose a path of redemption or embrace the darkness?\nPrompt:\nThe dungeon passageways stretch into the distance, lit by torchlight. The air is dry and stale and smells strongly of mold. You have been here longer than any sane person could stand; a century perhaps? Two? Three? Time has lost all meaning. The only things that matter now are hunger and thirst. You must eat and drink, else you will surely perish in this wretched place.\nAfter wandering aimlessly for a while, you hear someone approaching in the darkness: shuffling footsteps accompanied by the occasional clang; the telltale sounds of a new adventurer come to make a name for themselves.\n***\n[ Type: Scenario; Name: Hellbound ]\nWith no memory of your former existence, you are summoned to a strange plane known as the mortal world. As a demon, you are bound by an unbreakable pact with your new master. Will you serve your new lord or risk everything to forsake him for a life of your own choosing?\nPrompt:\nYou wake up in a dilapidated mansion with a hellhound at your side. You know nothing of your past life in hell, but you are aware of your situation. You are a freshly summoned demon bound by a blood pact and must work for your new master.\nYou stare up into the darkness of the room, taking in your surroundings. The wooden floorboards creak under your feet and the air is thick with the smell of decay. You hear a voice utter your name, a voice you would soon know well.\n***\n[ Type: Scenario ]\nIn an alternate version of history, the Nazis won World War II. They conquered Europe, and the United States fell under a Nazi-like regime. In the aftermath of war, a massive scientific project was launched, creating advanced weapons like flying saucers, giant robots, and even cyborg soldiersâ€”and you are one such soldier!\nPrompt:\nIt takes years of training and conditioning to prepare you for combat. You have learned how to use your prosthetic limbs to devastating effect, but have never seen battle. You have no idea how to fight or what your role should be. All you know is that someday you will have to prove that you deserve to live. Your superiors tell you that this day may be coming soon.\nYour mind races with thoughts of the future and what it might hold, but before you are able to think them over, you hear the sound of a door opening.\n***\n[ Type: Scenario; Name: The Ancient Automaton ]\nExplore a wild and strangely beautiful far future dystopia overrun by androids and exotic beasts. What secrets will you discover?\nPrompt:\nBeneath the planet's lush exterior lies an endless labyrinth of impossible machinery, and at its heart sleeps a terrible power. Despite centuries of cataclysms, a sparse few societies have survived. The inhabitants scour frozen obsidian steppes, salt marshes, and jungles of sentient plants in search of mysterious artifacts left behind by long-dead civilizations. In the darkness old gods stir, heeding the call of long-forgotten magic and the resolution of a millennia-long mystery.\nThe sky was dark when we made our way down the mountain trail. It had been nearly two days since we'd fled the city. My body ached all overâ€”especially my headâ€”but determination kept my mind clear. We'd made good time on our journey through the mountains, but we still hadn't reached the border yet. As the cloud layer began to clear, we spotted a figure crouching in a rust pile ahead. The woman stood as we approached, her back turned to us. But something was off.\n***\n[ Type: Scenario ]\nA god is wounded by the hand of another god, who then flees in shame to a distant land where he becomes an outcast. In his absence the world has begun to perish. The sun has gone dark and will not rise again; the stars have faded and the moon wanes ever further into shadow. The Earth itself begins to crack, and maggots swarm from cavities in the soil. The people flee and hide wherever they can. Some try to dig into the earth for safety but cannot resist the pull of corruption and ruin. Others turn to prayer and hope for salvation at the hands of the Gods.\nPrompt:\nThe God of Darkness, Bha'lazshar, is mortally injured by the God of Light, A'mahr. He sends forth a messenger bearing news of his defeat. To conceal his presence and avoid detection in case any surviving gods seek retribution, the messenger hides himself among mortals and assumes a mortal guise.\nHe calls upon you and your companions. You set off on your journey across the face of the dying planet when you notice something awry at your first destination.\n***\n[ Type: Scenario ]\nIn the year 2077, the city of Tethyr has fallen into chaos following a mysterious digital plague. Crime runs rampant and violence rages unchecked throughout the streets. The mega corporations that run Tethyr are powerless to stop these events or restore order. When a cybernetics specialist arrives to investigate the cause of the madness, she finds herself caught between conflicting forces, both human and android, as authorities struggle to contain the outbreak and its source.\nPrompt:\nYou're a cyberneticist working for a private security company. Your job is to track down the source of the virus infesting the city's network systems and neutralize the threat. However, you've just arrived in town and don't know anyone. Fortunately, there's a helpful stranger around the corner...\n***",
